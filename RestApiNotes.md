# What is REST?

* Resource based (REST) rather than action based services (SOAP API)

* Resources identified by URIs

* Can have multiple services per URI as long as they are different types (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

* Representations separate from the Resource.  The URI is not necessarily the physical directory location of the resource.
